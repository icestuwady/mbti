My stomach growls. \r\n\r\nI\'m really someone who cares about other people. The more people around you Is affecting our feelings really like care too much. But it\'s true that most people tend to care more about others than themselves.\r\n\r\nI don\'t like the feeling that I\'m going to find something toxic. It\'s like I like to think about it and think about it, like I\'m going to meet the type of person I don\'t like. What are you worried about? That we will accidentally do something that we don\'t like to put on other people? I feel like if it was like that, we would be a very bad person right?\r\n\r\nLike any period of life there is stress. different stress relief Who said that they want to go back to being a child? But I feel that when I was young, we had stress. At that time we thought it was a big deal. That is, no matter what stage of life there are things to be stressed about. Why can\'t people be happy?\r\n\r\nWell, the mood is up and down right now. Like a crazy person or that we\'ve been in the room for too long Well, I want to travel. But the situation is not getting better, it\'s difficult to do anything.\r\n\r\nHonestly, happiness is as simple as having money to buy delicious food that you want to eat. Have money to buy things you want to buy. have money to travel Who said money can\'t buy happiness? this is not true\r\n\r\nSeriously, like everyone, they\'re all dumbfounded and didn\'t go out at all. I\'m afraid to go anywhere Will not travel to the fullest. not relieve stress I\'m going to get excited for a while. You have to take special care of yourself. Traveling with foreign countries where they take off their masks You can arrange a meeting.\r\n\r\nIt\'s like waking up early to sit and study online, sit and eat, work, and sleep like you\'re not living your life. like life without color Really, it\'s like running out of passion as well.

People who are addicted to it are increasing every day. I don\'t see what the government will do. It doesn\'t solve the problem. Where will the country be opened? like Thai people by leaving to help each other It\'s like having to deal with specific problems on your own.\r\n\r\nThailand is not an underdeveloped country. It is a country that has never been developed. There has never been anything better.\r\n\r\nThailand that is looking to buy everything by itself that checks for covids, tens of thousands of vaccines that are queued for waiting. When will I get an injection? Where you have to wait in long queues, doctors and nurses are pitiful. Medical personnel are also pathetic to do their duty. But it\'s like the government doesn\'t care about anything. There are countries that are slowly going backwards.\r\n\r\nI really don\'t like it I don\'t want to study. When I sit and think, I don\'t know what to do after graduation. I don\'t know what you like not good at all don\'t know which way to go\r\n\r\nI just think that working people get up early to go to work, traffic jams, bad environment. Well, I don\'t want to grow up. It\'s like I don\'t really know what we want to do. I just wanted to be rich. I want to sleep and spend money at home.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating, the starting salary is less compared to other countries, but Thailand is almost dead. How stressful because of studying and after graduating, working after the crooked, earning a lower salary than other countries Welfare is less Quality of bad life  nothing good\r\n\r\nWell, where is this government going to give half? That is, everyone wants to have a good quality of life. I didn\'t want the money I borrowed. Or take the tax that we pay again. or like there is no future\r\n\r\nI want everyone to be polite. No matter who you want to have No matter how old you are Like with older people or younger people? I want to be more respectful It\'s like everyone does things like taking care of themselves and forgetting to think about other people\'s feelings.\r\n\r\nI\'m confused as everyone says that when we describe someone who is older is an argument. what is not understand I just asked if you want to know or what.

I want to live a normal life The crossover vaccine is why?\r\n\r\nI don\'t know. I want to be rich in this life.

If there is a good administration of the country This time I should be able to travel. What\'s this, lying in quarantine?\r\n\r\nis that education is not enough for physical health more mental health I don\'t know, studying is very tiring. Who said it was easy to study?

I\'m stupid. I don\'t know either. but please listen to the people in the group I want to eat something delicious at 5 PM. It\'s almost midnight. Confused? My stomach growls. I\'m really someone who cares about other people. The more people around you Is affecting our feelings really like care too much. But it\'s true that most people tend to care more about others than themselves. I don\'t like the feeling that I\'m going to find something toxic. It\'s like I like to think about it and think about it, like I\'m going to meet the type of person I don\'t like. What are you worried about? That we will accidentally do something that we don\'t like to put on other people? I feel like if it was like that, we would be a very bad person right? Like any period of life there is stress. different stress relief Who said that they want to go back to being a child? But I feel that when I was young, we had stress. At that time we thought it was a big deal. That is, no matter what stage of life there are things to be stressed about. Why can\'t people be happy? Well, the mood is up and down right now. Like a crazy person or that we\'ve been in the room for too long Well, I want to travel. But the situation is not getting better, it\'s difficult to do anything. Honestly, happiness is as simple as having money to buy delicious food that you want to eat. Have money to buy things you want to buy. have money to travel Who said money can\'t buy happiness? this is not true Seriously, like everyone, they\'re all dumbfounded and didn\'t go out at all. I\'m afraid to go anywhere Will not travel to the fullest. not relieve stress I\'m going to get excited for a while. You have to take special care of yourself. Traveling with foreign countries where they take off their masks You can arrange a meeting. It\'s like waking up early to sit and study online, sit and eat, work, and sleep like you\'re not living your life. like life without color Really, it\'s like running out of passion as well. I don\'t know what to do stay in room it\'s all bored like not going anywhere I didn\'t go out to look at the logo outside and it was depressing today the death toll is increasing day by day. People who are addicted to it are increasing every day. I don\'t see what the government will do. It doesn\'t solve the problem. Where will the country be opened? like Thai people by leaving to help each other It\'s like having to deal with specific problems on your own. Thailand is not an underdeveloped country. It is a country that has never been developed. There has never been anything better. Thailand that is looking to buy everything by itself that checks for covids, tens of thousands of vaccines that are queued for waiting. When will I get an injection? Where you have to wait in long queues, doctors and nurses are pitiful. Medical personnel are also pathetic to do their duty. But it\'s like the government doesn\'t care about anything. There are countries that are slowly going backwards. I really don\'t like it I don\'t want to study. When I sit and think, I don\'t know what to do after graduation. I don\'t know what you like not good at all don\'t know which way to go I just think that working people get up early to go to work, traffic jams, bad environment. Well, I don\'t want to grow up. It\'s like I don\'t really know what we want to do. I just wanted to be rich. I want to sleep and spend money at home. After graduating, the starting salary is less compared to other countries, but Thailand is almost dead. How stressful because of studying and after graduating, working after the crooked, earning a lower salary than other countries Welfare is less Quality of bad life nothing good Well, where is this government going to give half? That is, everyone wants to have a good quality of life. I didn\'t want the money I borrowed. Or take the tax that we pay again. or like there is no future I want everyone to be polite. No matter who you want to have No matter how old you are Like with older people or younger people? I want to be more respectful It\'s like everyone does things like taking care of themselves and forgetting to think about other people\'s feelings. I\'m confused as everyone says that when we describe someone who is older is an argument. what is not understand I just asked if you want to know or what. I mean, how did we explain? and argue is not wanting to say Well, when will I get a good vaccine to inject with him? I want to live a normal life The crossover vaccine is why? I don\'t know. I want to be rich in this life. How do you feel richer than poor? size of political matters or whatever All races are divided on money. Like who has more, it has more power. If the economy is good, everything is good. If there is a good administration of the country This time I should be able to travel. What\'s this, lying in quarantine? is that education is not enough for physical health more mental health I don\'t know, studying is very tiring. Who said it was easy to study? I think it\'s heavy.
