              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">​ESFP (extraverted, sensing, feeling, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI). People with ESFP personality types are often described as spontaneous, resourceful, and outgoing. They love being the center of attention and are often described as entertainers or “class clowns.” ESFP is the opposite of the INTJ personality type.
                <br><br>According to psychologist David Keirsey, the developer of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately 4% to 10% of all people have an ESFP personality type.

              <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Key ESFP Characteristics</h1><br>
              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px;">- ESFP tend to be very practical and resourceful. They prefer to learn through hands-on experience and tend to dislike book learning and theoretical discussions. Because of this, students with ESFP personality types sometimes struggle in traditional classroom settings. However, they excel in situations where they are allowed to interact with others or learn through direct experience.
                <br><br>- ESFP live very much in the here-and-now and sometimes fail to think about how current actions will lead to long-term consequences. They will often rush into a new situation and figure things out as they happen. They also tend to dislike routine, enjoy new experiences, and are always looking for a new adventure.
                <br><br>- In addition to having a strong awareness of their surroundings, they are also very understanding and perceptive when it comes to other people. They are able to sense what others are feeling and know how to respond. People tend to find them warm, sympathetic, and easygoing.
                <br><br>- While ESFP are fun-loving and do not shun the spotlight, they are more interested in simply living in the present and doing what feels right at that moment.

                <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Personal Relationships</h1><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">As extroverts, ESFP enjoy spending time with other people and have excellent interpersonal skills.2 They are good at understanding how other people are feeling and can respond to other people's emotions in productive ways. For this reason, ESFP can make good leaders and have a knack for mobilizing, motivating, and persuading group members.
                <br><br>They typically feel insecure in situations where things are uncertain or chaotic. While this makes ESFJs well suited to positions that involve managing or supervising people, it can also lead to conflicts when they try to exercise control over people who do not welcome such direction.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">With their strong dislike for routine, ESFP do best in careers that involve a lot of variety. Jobs that involve a great deal of socializing are also a great fit, allowing individuals with this personality type to put their considerable people skills to good use. Careers that involve a great deal of structure and solitary work can be difficult for ESFP, and they often become bored in such situations.
