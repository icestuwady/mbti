              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">​​​INTP (introverted, intuitive, thinking, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality types described by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI). People who score as INTP are often described as quiet and analytical. They enjoy spending time alone, thinking about how things work, and coming up with solutions to problems. INTPs have a rich inner world and would rather focus their attention on their internal thoughts rather than the external world. They typically do not have a wide social circle, but they do tend to be close to a select group of people.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">As introverts, INTP prefer spending time alone for the most part. Unlike extroverts, who gain energy from interacting with a wide group of people, introverts must expend energy in social situations. After being around a lot of people, INTPs might feel like they need to spend some time alone to recharge and find balance. While they may be shy around people they do not know well, INTPs tend to be warm and friendly with their close group of family and friends.
                <br><br>Because INTP enjoy solitude and deep thinking, they sometimes strike others as aloof and detached. At times, people with this personality type can get lost in their own thoughts and lose track of the outside world. They love ideas and place a high value on intelligence and knowledge.
                <br><br>In social situations, INTP tend to be quite easy-going and tolerant. However, they can become unyielding when their beliefs or convictions are challenged. Their high emphasis on logic can make it difficult to not correct others in situations where other people present arguments that are not rational or logical. Because they rely on their own minds rather than others, they can also be very difficult to persuade.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">Because they enjoy theoretical and abstract concepts, INTP often do particularly well in science-related careers. They are logical and have strong reasoning skills, but are also excellent at thinking creatively.
                    <br><br>INTP can be very independent and place a great deal of emphasis on personal freedom and autonomy. In some cases, they can be aggravated by authority figures, particularly those that they feel are trying to suppress their ability to think and act for themselves. Because of this, INTPs typically do best in careers as they have a great deal of flexibility and independence.
