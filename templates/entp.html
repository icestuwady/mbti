              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">â€‹ENTP is one of the 16 different personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI).People with this personality type are often described as innovative, clever, and expressive. ENTPs are also known for being idea-oriented, which is why this personality type has been described as "the innovator," "the visionary," and "the debater."
                <br><br>ENTPs are less interested in the here-and-now details than they are in generating ideas and theories. Because of this, they sometimes tend to come up with one idea after another without actually going forward with plans and actions to bring their creative notions into fruition.

              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px;">- ENTP enjoy interacting with a wide variety of people. They are great conversationalists and love to engage other people in debates.
                <br><br>- They are more focused on the future rather than on immediate details. They may start projects and never finish them because they are so focused on the big picture rather than the present needs.
                <br><br>- ENTP enjoy being around other people, particularly if they are able to engage in a conversation or debate about something in which they are interested. They are usually fairly laid-back and easy to get along with. However, they can sometimes get so wrapped up in their ideas or plans that they lose sight of their close relationships.
                <br><br>- They tend to reserve judgment. Instead of making a decision or committing to a course of action, they would prefer to wait and see what happens.
                <br><br>- ENTP are immensely curious and focused on understanding the world around them. They are constantly absorbing new information and ideas and quickly arriving at conclusions. They are able to understand new things quite quickly.
                <br><br>- One common myth about ENTPs is that they love to argue simply for the sake of arguing. While people with this personality type are often willing to play the devil's advocate at times, they enjoy debates as a way of exploring a topic, learning what other people believe, and helping others see the other side of the story.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">Since they are identified as extroverts, it may come as no surprise that ENTP have very good people skills. They are skilled communicators and enjoy interacting with a wide circle of family, friends, and acquaintances. In conversations, other people often find them quick-witted.
                <br><br>ENTP will often engage in debates simply because they enjoy having a good battle of the wits. Sometimes, their love of debates lead ENTP to take on the role of the devil's advocate, which can sometimes lead to conflicts with others who feel like they are being intentionally combative and antagonistic.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">Routines and boredom are not good for the ENTP personality. They are non-conformists and do best in jobs when they can find excitement and express their creative freedom. ENTP can be successful in a wide range of careers, as long as they do not feel hemmed in or bored.
                    <br><br>As debaters with great communication skills, careers in law can offer the challenge and diversity that ENTP crave. Jobs in the business world that combine the ENTP rationality, creativity, and natural leadership abilities can also be very rewarding.
