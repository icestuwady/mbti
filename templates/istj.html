              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">​​​ ISTJ (introversion, sensing, thinking, judgment) is a four-letter code representing one of the 16 personality types found on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI). People with an ISTJ personality type tend to be reserved, practical and quiet. They enjoy order and organization in all areas of their lives including their home, work, family, and projects. ISTJs value loyalty in themselves and others, and place an emphasis on traditions.

              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px;">- ISTJ are planners; they like to carefully plan things out well in advance. They enjoy an orderly life. They like things to be well-organized and pay a great deal of attention to detail. When things are in disarray, people with this personality type may find themselves unable to rest until they have set everything straight and the work has been completed.
                <br><br>- ISTJ are both responsible and realistic. They take a logical approach to achieving goals and completing projects and are able to work at a steady pace toward accomplishing these tasks. They are able to ignore distractions in order to focus on the task at hand and are often described as dependable and trustworthy.
                <br><br>- ISTJ also place a great deal of emphasis on traditions and laws. They prefer to follow rules and procedures that have previously been established. In some cases, ISTJs can seem rigid and unyielding in their desire to maintain structure.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">​​ISTJs prefer spending time alone or with small groups of close friends. People with this personality type are usually very loyal and devoted to family and friends but may struggle to understand their own emotions and the feelings of others. They can be quite reserved and sometimes fail to pick up on the emotional signals given by other people. However, once they are close to a person and develop an understanding of that person's feelings and needs, they will expend a great deal of effort toward supporting those needs.

                <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Career Paths</h1><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">Because of this need for order, they tend to do better in learning and work environments that have clearly defined schedules, clear-cut assignments, and a strong focus on the task at hand. When learning new things, ISTJs do best when the material is something they view as useful with real-world applications. Concrete, factual information appeals to ISTJs, while theoretical and abstract information has little value unless they can see some type of practical use for it. While they may exert tremendous energy into projects they see as valuable, they will avoid wasting time and energy on things that they view as useless or unpractical.
                    <br><br>ISTJs tend to do well in careers that require order, structure, and perseverance. Jobs that involve dealing with concrete facts and figures (accounting, library science, computer programming, etc.) are all good options. Jobs that require accuracy, respect for rules and stability often appeal to those with an ISTJ personality.
