              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">INTJ (introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging) is one of the 16 personality types identified by a personality assessment called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI). Sometimes referred to as the "Architect" or the "Strategist," people with INTJ personalities are highly analytical, creative, and logical.
                <br><br>According to psychologist David Keirsey, developer of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately 1 to 4% of the population has an INTJ personality type.
                <br><br>The MBTI is one of the most popular psychological assessments, but critics have argued that it lacks both validity and reliability. If you take the MBTI, be sure to use caution when considering the meaning of your results.

              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px;">- ​INTJ tend to be introverted and prefer to work alone.
                <br><br>- INTJ look at the big picture and like to focus on abstract information rather than concrete details.
                <br><br>- INTJs place greater emphasis on logic and objective information rather than subjective emotions.
                <br><br>- INTJ like their world to feel controlled and ordered so they prefer to make plans well in advance.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">​​People with this personality type are introverted and spend a lot of time in their own mind. INTJs work best by themselves and strongly prefer solitary work to group work.
                <br><br>While they tend not to be particularly interested in other people's thoughts and feelings, they do care about the emotions of the select group of people to whom they are close. In personal relationships, INTJs are willing to devote time and energy toward making these relationships successful.
                <br><br>Other people often interpret INTJ as cool, aloof, and disinterested, which can make forming new friendships challenging. People with this type of personality often see little value in social rituals and small talk, making it even more difficult to get to know them. They tend to be reserved and prefer to interact with a group of close family and friends.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">​When INTJ develop an interest in something, they strive to become as knowledgeable and skilled as they can in that area. They have high expectations, and they hold themselves to the highest possible standards.
                    <br><br>INTJ are good at gathering information from the outside world, analyzing it, and reaching new insights. People with this personality type tend to be very analytical and logical. They value information, knowledge, and intelligence, and make excellent scientists and mathematicians. They tend to do particularly well in fields that require efficiency and the ability to interpret complex information such as engineering, academia, law, and research.
                    <br><br>INTJ typically do well in careers that integrate their strong ability to understand and evaluate complex information with their ability to put this knowledge into practice. Careers that allow the INTJ to work independently and autonomously are also ideal.
