              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">​​​ ​ISTP (introverted, sensing, thinking, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI). People with ISTP personalities enjoy having time to think alone and are fiercely independent. ISTP also love action, new experiences, hands-on activities, and the freedom to work at their own pace.

              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px;">- People with an ISTP personality are results-oriented. When there is a problem, they want to quickly understand the underlying cause and implement some type of solution.
                <br><br>- ISTP enjoy new experiences and may often engage in thrill-seeking or even risk-taking behaviors. They often engage in risky or fast-paced hobbies such as motorcycling, hang gliding, bungee jumping, surfing, or ice hockey. In some cases, they may seek out adventure by choosing careers in areas such as racing, flying, or firefighting.
                <br><br>- They prefer to make judgments based upon objective criteria rather than personal beliefs or values.
                <br><br>- ISTP are often described as quiet, but with an easygoing attitude towards others.
                <br><br>- ISTP are not well attuned to the emotional states of others, and they can sometimes be seen as a bit insensitive. They also distance themselves from their own emotions, ignoring their feelings until they become overwhelming.
                <br><br>- One common misconception about ISTPs is that they are the stoic, silent type. While they do tend to be reserved, this does not mean that they do not experience strong emotions. Instead, they are good at keeping a cool head, maintaining their objectivity, and coping with crisis.

                <h1 style="font-size: 40px;">Personal Relationships</h1><br>
                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">​ISTP are introverts and they tend to be quiet and reserved. They thrive on new experiences and dislike strict routines. In relationships, they are highly independent and do not like to feel controlled. Making commitments is difficult for the ISTP, but will put a lot of effort into relationships that hold their interest.
                    <br><br>They do not often share their emotions with other people. While they enjoy hearing what other people think, they frequently keep their own opinions to themselves. For these reasons, people sometimes describe ISTP as difficult to get to know. They often find friends who enjoy similar hobbies as they do and enjoy spending time with these friends as they pursue these activities.

                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">Because ISTPs are introverted, they often do well in jobs that require working alone. ISTP tend to dislike too much structure and do well in careers where they have a lot of freedom and autonomy. Because they are very logical, they often enjoy work that involves reasoning and hands-on experience. In particular, ISTP like doing things that have practical, real-world applications.
