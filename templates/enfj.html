              <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100px; text-indent: 2.5em;">ENFJ, also known as the giver or protagonist personality, is one of the 16 different personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI).Some other types are known by the acronyms ESFJ, ENFP, INFP, and INTP.
                <br><br>People with ENFJ personality type are often described as warm, outgoing, loyal, and sensitive.
                <br><br>Of all the personality types, the ENFJ is often perceived as being the strongest "people person." They are capable of forging friendships with all personality types, even with more introverted or reticent individuals.
                <br><br>Because of their ability to sense what others feel and affect how people behave, they do have the ability to influence and even manipulate others. This is balanced by their strong value system and desire to help other people be the best that they can be. ENFJ is the opposite of the ISTP personality type.
                <br><br>Psychologist David Keirsey suggests that approximately 2% to 5% of all people have an ENFJ personality.
